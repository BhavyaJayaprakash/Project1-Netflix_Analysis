Bhavya Jayaprakash 
Question 1 
Part 1 - what is the mix of TC shows vs Movie between Netflix and Hulu
Part 2- what is the distribution of rating of movies between Netflix and Hulu

Statistical Analysis:
If one could only choose one streaming service, what would it be? What content is Netflix focusing on vs Hulu ? It's hard to determine which streaming service is truly "better" because that will greatly depend on an individual's personal preferences. But in this era of digital entertainment, streaming platforms have revolutionized how we consume media. Among the leading players, Netflix and Hulu have emerged as prominent services with diverse content libraries. However, their offerings differ significantly in terms of type of content, genres , rating etc. This analysis project aims to provide an in-depth comparison of the content between Netflix and Hulu by visualizing their catalog data. this would help users understand the content dynamics while showcasing data analysis and visualization techniques.

Conclusion:
The analysis reveals clear distinctions between Netflix and Hulu in terms of their content focus
Netflix stands out as the platform with a more extensive collection of movies. Its vast library caters to a diverse audience seeking cinematic experiences across various genres.
Hulu, on the other hand, excels in its offering of TV shows, making it an ideal choice for viewers who prefer binge worthy series and ongoing television programing.
These findings highlight the strengths of each platform that can guide users in selecting the service that aligns with their preferences.


QUestion 2 : How are our users primarily watching netflix and is that different based on region or age group?
This question gives us a deeper insight into who a netflix subscriber is. When we know our audience better we know how to best cater to them and not only that how to get more people to subscribe that are similar to the current audience. This helps us get a better insight on how to market to these groups of people.

The way that we are going to explore netflix subscribers is by understanding what kinds of devices do our different users like to us to stream and see what the user device preferences are across regions and age groups.

Devices Types amongst Regions
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec9a4020-64f5-431e-b178-4ddd07263735)

Australia has a preference to smartphones and are less likely to use a Smart TV.
North America has a preference to tablets.
South America has a preference to smartphones and are less likely to use a Smart TV.
Europe has a preference laptops.

Conclusion: reviewing the data set based on continent it does seem like netflix users do have a device preference based on region. Subscribers all around the world prefer to watch netflix on a mobile device rather than a TV. This means that our subscribers enjoy watching Netflix on the go, which is one of the things that Netflix heavily promotes.

It seems like Australia and South America seem to be more likely to watch on their smart phones than the subscribers in other continents.

Ages 26-29: tablets
Ages 30-35: little difference in preference
Ages 36-40: smartphones
Ages 41-45: laptops 
Ages 46-51: little difference in top 3 but use smart phones less than other age groups 

The younger users (26-29) are slightly more versatile in their device usage. The youngest age group seems to prefer the usage of a tablet with with a laptop being their least favorite device. It seems as the the older the population of subscribers gets the more defined their preference or dislike of a device becomes. The oldest age group (46-51) does not like using smart phones as much as the other age groups. The second oldest age group (41-45) likes to be more on the go with a strong preference to their laptops and a dislike of Smart TVs in comparison to the other age groups.
It does seem like our users have a strong preference for mobile devices rather than TVs which means that across age groups it is more popular to be on the go.

This data reveals significant variations in subscription preferences across regions, reflecting possible cultural or economic factors influencing user choices.



Data Set Limitations:
Our Netflix User Dataset is small of only 2500 users in different areas of the world, which is a really small portion of the population of Netflix users that is closer to 283 million. We are also not so sure how the data was collected and if truly was a random sample of the netflix subscribers. 

This dataset gives us information of the members that pay for the service but it does not give us information on the people within that household that use the service. If there is a way to get household information from the Netflix profiles that could definitely gives us an accurate depiction of who netflix streamers are as a whole. 

For the device usage by continent data, the data available was grouped by continent but that meant that certain area had more data representing that region than others. For example, to represent South America we only had data from Brazil (population sample size of which is not an accurate representation of the South American population. Where as, Europe had 5 countries (population sample size of 1183) and North America  had 3 countries with a (population sample size of 951) and so there was a larger population represented in those groups than there was for South America or Australia (each with a population of 183 which is significantly less data on the population in North America and Europe). 

The data is static and may not reflect dynamic changes, such as titles added or removed from the platform. Changes in subscribers over the years.

Conclusions:

Subscribers like to watch on the go! Across age groups and regions, users prefer mobile devices.
Netflix is the go to platform for movie enthusiast and younger viewers, while Hulu shines as the choice for TV show lovers and older audiences. These complementary strengths highlight how each platform caters to different demographics , making the streaming landscape diverse and user focused.
Basic subscriptions dominate in South America, while Premium is most concentrated in Australia. Standard subscriptions are strongest in North America but also significant in the EU. Each subscription type shows distinct regional preferences.
